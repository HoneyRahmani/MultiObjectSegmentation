# Multi Object Segmentation - Pytorch
## About the Project
This project focuses on developing a deep-learning model using PyTorch to outline the boundary of target objects in an image by a same size segmentation mask image. The segmentation mask is an image that each pixel in the image is labeled based on its object class. Thus, the task is multi-object segmentation and goal is to predict segmentation mask.
In this project, automatically segmenting 20 target objects in the Visual Object Classes (VOC) dataset is performed.
